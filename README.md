A machine learning web application that predicts the win probability of an IPL cricket match in real-time based on the current match situation.

## 🌟 Overview
Cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL), is a game of uncertainties. Often, a single over can tilt the balance of the match. This project utilizes historical IPL data to build a predictive model that estimates the probability of the chasing team winning the match, given the current match scenario.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Predictions**: Calculates the probability of either team winning based on current match stats.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Dropdowns for Batting Team, Bowling Team, Host City, and inputs for Target, Current Score, Overs Completed, and Wickets Out.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend & App Framework**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression Pipeline)
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Serialization**: Pickle
